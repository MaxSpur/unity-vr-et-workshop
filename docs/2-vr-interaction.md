# Interaction in VR

Let's now dig into actually using VR with Unity. For that we need to add some additional packages to Unity which will be specific to the hardware we're using for this tutorial — the HTC Vive Pro Eye.

## A new project

Let's first of all create a new Unity 3D project with the hub, like before. You can close the one from the previous tutorial, we won't be needing it anymore. Set up the new project's window like we did for the first tutorial, or to your own liking.

### Installing and importing Packages

In the Unity editor's menu bar, go to __Window → Package Manager__, which will open a new floating window. Selecting *My Assets* from the __Packages__ drop-down menu at the top, type in `steamvr` in the search box and you should have the *SteamVR Plugin* appear — import it with the __Import__ button below.
