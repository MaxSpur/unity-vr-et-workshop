## Create A Project Using The Hub

If not already running on your computer, start the Unity Hub (see the icon above). Depending on previous use there may be already projects listed in its window — if so, disregard them for now and just click the __New project__ button.

You will be presented with a dialog to configure the project. Usually it's already all set up correctly, but to make sure just verify the following points:

+ __Editor Version__ should be the latest one from the list (2021.3.11f1 in our case),
+ The __3D__ *template* should be selected,
+ Don't forget to give your first project a name and choose a location (the default works here).

Pushing the __Create project__ button will open the *Unity Editor* and tell it create a new project with the above parameters. This may take some time…
