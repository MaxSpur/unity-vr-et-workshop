Hello and thank you for participating in this workshop! Here you'll learn about the basics of the Unity game engine : How to create and run a first 3D environment How to interact with 3D objects and how to animate them, and How to script them with more complex behaviors. More specifically for a use-case in psychological/perceptual research, it will also teach you about: Setting up a VR environment with eye tracking (specifically the HTC Vive Pro Eye), Recording and outputting eye tracking data from players or participants, and How to interpret these results. In order to condense the workshop and save time, we have already prepared the computers you'll be working on with all necessary software and editing environments. If you want to repeat the process on your own equipment or in your lab, the page on Installation and Setup will lead you to our recommended setup, but for now you can directly start with the first part , which will teach you about creating your first unity project with a simple 3D object. You can navigate the page with the buttons below, or using the links in the directory on the left (or behind the menu icon). Feel free to ask you tutors about any issues you might be having at any point, they are here to help you. We hope you'll enjoy the journey!","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-unity-vr-and-eye-tracking-workshop","text":"Hello and thank you for participating in this workshop!
